# emacs-pkgs

Packages I've written for my own convenience, published in an Elpa repo.

## Installation

Don't install this! Instead, use these packages from an Emacs package repository. I've set up a repository at <https://pgroce.github.io//emacs-pkgs/elpa/>. Add it to the `package-archives` variable in Emacs and you can install them using the standard Emacs package mechanisms.

## Packages

All of the `.org` files in the files list will describe the library. Documentation is usually minimal, especially the packages I created just to make my own configuration file a little cleaner.
